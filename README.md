TaskFleet

A Web-Based Multi-Agent DevOps Orchestrator

TaskFleet is a browser-based multi-agent DevOps platform that allows developers and small teams to delegate coding tasks to AI agents, execute multiple tasks in parallel, and supervise the entire workflow from a single live dashboard.

Instead of running one AI coding agent at a time, TaskFleet provides isolated workers, a common agent plugin interface, real-time task tracking, GitHub/CI integration, and a security gate for agent-generated code.

Project: Semester Group Project
Program: B.Tech CSE
Institution: KIET Group of Institutions

🚀 Problem Statement

Running a single AI coding agent on one task is relatively simple. However, running multiple agents against the same repository simultaneously introduces several coordination problems:

Branch and working-directory collisions

Loss of context about which agent is working on which task

No centralized view of task progress

Difficulty tracking blocked tasks

Manual handling of CI failures and review comments

Security risks from AI-generated code

Vendor lock-in when using a single AI agent

TaskFleet addresses these problems by providing:

Isolated Workers — one task, one agent, one Git branch/worktree.

Agent Plugin Interface — a common interface for different AI coding agents.

Live Kanban Board — real-time task state based on Git, CI, and PR signals.

Feedback Loop — CI failures and review comments can be routed back to the responsible worker.

SecOps Gate — automated security checks before code reaches the merge-ready state.

✨ Key Features

🤖 Multi-Agent Task Execution

Create coding tasks using natural language and assign them to an AI coding agent.

⚡ Parallel Execution

Multiple workers can execute different tasks concurrently without overwriting each other's work.

🌿 Git Worktree Isolation

Every worker receives its own Git branch and worktree, preventing file-level conflicts between agents.

🐳 Docker-Based Worker Isolation

Workers execute inside separate Docker containers to reduce the impact of runaway or malicious agent processes.

🔌 Agent Plugin Architecture

TaskFleet uses a common adapter interface so different agents can be integrated without changing the orchestration core.

Planned/targeted integrations include:

Anthropic Claude API

OpenAI-compatible APIs

CLI-based coding agents

Other agents implementing the TaskFleet adapter contract

📊 Live Kanban Dashboard

The dashboard tracks states such as:

Working

Needs Attention

In Review

Ready to Merge

Updates are delivered through WebSockets, eliminating the need for manual page refreshes.

🔄 CI & Review Feedback Loop

GitHub commits, pull requests, CI results, and review comments are used to derive task state.

When CI fails or a reviewer requests changes, the feedback can be routed back to the same worker so the agent can attempt a fix.

🛡️ SecOps Pipeline

Agent-generated code is intended to pass automated security checks before reaching the merge-ready stage:

Gitleaks — secret scanning

Trivy — dependency/container scanning

Semgrep — static application security testing (SAST)

🔐 GitHub OAuth

Team members can authenticate using GitHub OAuth with scoped repository access.

🏗️ System Architecture

TaskFleet follows a three-layer architecture.

🔒 Isolation Model

Isolation is a core part of TaskFleet because multiple AI agents may operate on the same repository concurrently.

Each worker receives:

A dedicated Docker container

A dedicated Git branch

A dedicated Git worktree

Its own execution environment

Per-container secrets

API keys and GitHub tokens should be injected through environment variables or a secrets manager rather than hard-coded or shared between workers.

🔄 Example Workflow

A team lead creates three tasks:

1. Add rate limiting to the authentication endpoint
2. Write unit tests for the payment module
3. Fix a flaky checkout CI test

TaskFleet assigns the tasks to separate Claude-backed workers.

Task 1 ──→ Worker A ──→ Branch A ──→ PR
Task 2 ──→ Worker B ──→ Branch B ──→ PR
Task 3 ──→ Worker C ──→ Branch C ──→ CI

Workers execute concurrently inside isolated Docker containers.

If Tasks 1 and 2 pass CI and security scanning, they can move automatically toward Ready to Merge.

If Task 3 fails CI:

CI Failure
    ↓
Failure information
    ↓
Original Worker
    ↓
Agent receives feedback
    ↓
Agent attempts fix
    ↓
New commit
    ↓
CI runs again

The team can supervise the entire workflow from the Kanban board without manually copying CI errors into an agent conversation.

🎯 Use Cases

Solo Developers

Run multiple independent tasks simultaneously instead of completing them sequentially.

Small Development Teams

Delegate well-scoped tasks such as:

Refactoring

Boilerplate generation

Test coverage

Database migrations

while humans focus on architecture and review.

Hackathons

Parallelize frontend, backend, and integration work when development time is limited.

Learning & Onboarding

Allow students or new developers to observe how an AI agent approaches a task through worker logs and diffs.

Security-Conscious Teams

Apply secret scanning, dependency scanning, and SAST checks to AI-generated code before merging.

⚙️ Development Principles

TaskFleet follows these core engineering principles:

Isolation first — agents should not interfere with one another.

Plugin-based agents — the orchestration core should not depend on one AI vendor.

Real-time visibility — task state should reflect actual Git/CI/PR activity.

Human supervision — AI agents execute tasks, while humans retain review and merge control.

Security by default — AI-generated code should pass automated security gates.

Incremental development — build a stable core first, then add integrations.

🔮 Future Scope

The architecture leaves room for additional coding-agent integrations, richer orchestration, and expanded DevOps automation.

Potential future improvements include:

More AI agent providers

More sophisticated task decomposition

Advanced worker scheduling

Better resource management

Expanded security policies

More detailed analytics and observability

Additional Git providers

Production-grade secrets management

More advanced CI/CD integrations

These are potential extensions rather than features confirmed as part of the current semester scope.

📄 Project Reference

TaskFleet is conceptually inspired by Agent Orchestrator (AO) and adapts the multi-agent coding orchestration concept into a browser-based, team-oriented platform with Docker worker isolation, Git worktrees, a plugin architecture, real-time Kanban monitoring, GitHub integration, and a SecOps gate.
